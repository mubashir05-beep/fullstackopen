# Full Stack Open 2021

 
This course by the University of Helsinki is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript. The focus is on single page applications implemented with React and supported with RESTful and GraphQL web services implemented with Node.js. Other topics include debugging applications, configuration, and managing runtime environments and NoSQL databases.

This repo contains my exercises to the 2022 course.
